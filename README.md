# Mapless Collision-Free Flight via MPC using Dual KD-Trees in Cluttered Environments

## 1. Introduction

Collision-free navigation in cluttered environments is essential for autonomous quadrotors. Traditional approaches typically rely on a cascade pipeline involving detailed 3D mapping, trajectory generation, and tracking. However, such methods can suffer from accumulated errors and computational latency, which limits agility and safety.

In this work, we propose a novel **mapless** method for collision-free flight without constructing explicit 3D maps or generating collision-free trajectories. Instead, we use **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** to directly generate safe control actions from sparse waypoints and point cloud data obtained from a depth camera.

Our approach introduces a **dual KD-tree** mechanism:
- The **Obstacle KD-Tree** identifies nearby obstacles for real-time avoidance.
- The **Edge KD-Tree** provides a strong initial guess to the MPC solver, helping it escape local minima.

We validate our method through both simulation and real-world experiments. Our results show that it:
- Outperforms traditional mapping-based approaches;
- Surpasses imitation learning-based methods;
- Achieves speeds of up to **12 m/s in simulation** and **6 m/s in real-world** scenarios.

This framework offers a robust and streamlined alternative to complex map-based planning systems.

## 3. Test On Airsim

Start a terminal and run airsim standalone
```
cd YOUR/SIMULARTOR/FOLDER
./tune_test.sh
```
Start another terminal to run avoid-MPC:
```
cd avoid_mpc/roswrapper/ros
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch avoid_mpc mpc_obstacle_avoidance.launch
```

## 4. TODO

- [ ] Release a simulation version based on [Flightmare](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare) to support richer visual-physical interaction scenarios
- [ ] Develop a ROS 2 compatible version to enable broader integration with modern robotic platforms
